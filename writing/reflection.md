## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in
blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and
meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection
 piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the
word,  with your response.

## First Tool

 SIFT
 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 SIFT is a prediction tool that uses the  state of having the same or
 similar relation, relative position, or structure of amino acids. The
 predictions are the effect of coding variants on protein function  

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 SIFT looks at the composition of amino acids and computes the score. Using an
 algorithm a SIFT score is a normalized probability of observing the new amino
 acid at that position, and ranges from 0 to 1. A value of between 0 and 0.05
 is predicted to affect protein function Using the HumVar and HumDiv data to
 Ensembl, RefSeq and UCSC Known ids using the UniProtKB id mapping tool.'

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 This was most likely developed as a much more efficient way to identify what
 are the causal variants for the phenotype or disease being studied since there
 is millions of variants though not all the variants are currently there since
 some could not  be mapped.  

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method
 of tool?
 An undesirable consequence of using this tool is sorting through the wrong data
thus making the wrong prediction for the reaction and the proteins it was trying
to predict could be wrong  also the research being conducted can go completely
  in the wrong direction for the research at hand. The time , money, and energy
  that could go into this false predictions may lead the method to be deemed
  inefficient and unusable so it would benefit either the user or the product
  itself if this were to happen


##   Second Tool

  MEGA(Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis)
 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
  This tool statistical analysis of molecular evolution and for constructing
 phylogenetic trees which includes many sophisticated methods and tools for
 phylogenomics and phylomedicine. The computing cores for many molecular
 evolutionary analyses to see the trees between genes. The exploration of
 sequence alignments, the enumeration of sequence divergence, the construction
 and visualization of phylogenetic trees, and the testing of
 molecular evolutionary hypotheses are some of the other features of this
 software.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 The method MEGA uses seems to be the integration of sequence
acquisition with evolutionary analysis. It contains an array of input data and
multiple results explorers for visual representation. The sequence alignment
editor uses genetic code to generate captions for distance matrices, phylogenies
, tests, alignments.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 The method was necessary to develop  due to the fact as a common place rather
 than having implements many analytical methods and tools. A more  efficient
 tool that can perform both sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis in
 simple way seems to be better than having multiple programs taking up space.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method
 of tool?
 Some undesirable consequences is the updated version of the is no longer
 compatible with mac user or other programs. Another consequence may be that the
 trees being analysis could misinterpreted which would be difficult if the
 information for the continuation of the experiment was incorrect
